        ABOUT LUSH HAIR
    </h1>
    <div>“Lush Hair Nigeria is a brand that has come a long way since its launch in 2018. With Green as its brand color, we had started with the production of crochet extensions and a range of braiding extension in natural colors. We, however, knew we could do more, and in early 2020, we underwent a complete rebranding with a new color —Pink—and a renewed commitment to providing high-quality products and a wider range of options. So far, we can confidently say we have made do with our commitment, and we show no signs of stopping anytime soon.</div>
